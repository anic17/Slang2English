# Slang2English
Batch program to convert slang english to better english and replacing abbreviated words.

## Usage:

You can run it from the console with command line arguments or directly without arguments.  
If the program is being ran without arguments, a prompt will appear and it will be paused at the end.

This is specially useful as a module for chatbots (Used on [RistMind](https://github.com/anic17/RistMind)) and interaction with programs, as people usually type fast and abbreviate a bunch of words.
